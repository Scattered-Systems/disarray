Disarray leverages a malleable core building off the component architecture being introduced in the WebAssembley Stack to deliver a high-preformant,
post-quantum multi-chian supporting both PoS and PoW workloads as acceptable means of generating new blocks. This chain serves as the technical foudnation 
for more rigorous services, Aether and Chaos, implementing optimized surfaces for executing a variety of different commands contexutalized and proxied 
according to the active Flow module.
